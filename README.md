# bike sharing analysis

In this project, we hope to provide insight for bike sharing operations management and also a useful case for other cities interested in adopting similar programs.

Bike sharing is a trend in the major cities in the US. These shared bikes decrease pollution in the city and provides flexible short distance travel. However, according to bike sharing usage data provided by SFMTA, average trip is less than 4000 per day considering 262 stations already set up in San Francisco

This report summarized some of the data modeling and analysis results associated with San Francisco bike sharing data obtained from Kaggle as well as additional feature data. Our overall goal for this project is to know are the following:
1.	Predict the number of station-based bike trip patterns vary by day-to-day basis
2.	Understand how different factors such as weather, demographics statistics, near-by business, bus stations, parks and recreations facilities affect bike usage.
